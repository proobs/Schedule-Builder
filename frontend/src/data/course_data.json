Applied Anthropology explores theories of practice, common methods used and refined by applied anthropologists, and the ethical debates surrounding applied work. In addition, students examine how understandings of culture, subjectivity, and sociohistorical experience can help inform interventions and policy.",

Topics will include: structure activity relationship studies (SAR), identification of the pharmacophore, stereochemical considerations, the role of electronic and H-bonding interactions, bioavailability, +chemical and metabolic stability, toxicity, drug metabolism, DNA interactive drugs, receptors and enzymes as drug targets, the design and mechanistic features of receptor and enzyme inhibitors and the pharmacokinetic variability and design of prodrugs, the advantages and disadvantages of using monotherapy vs combination therapies such as multitargeted drugs, dual inhibitors and mutual prodrugs, among other current approaches to drug design. Additional topics will include the use of computers in drug design, the development of resistance, use of synergism in multidrug therapy, clinical trials, patent issues as well as moral and ethical responsibilities facing medicinal chemists. Case studies will focus on currently used (or recently used, but discontinued) drugs, particularly those reflecting controversy or innovation, as well as historical perspectives.",

        "Description": "The World Government Summit in 2021 found that global healthcare systems are ill equipped to meet the demands of the populations they serve. Health systems continuously face major threats arising from various factors such as acute shocks (such as disasters) to more chronic stressors. Governments, policy makers, and academics are recognizing the need to adapt to increasing volatility, uncertainty, and complexity, and to take urgent steps to renew and increase focus on building resilience by addressing critical gaps that make health systems vulnerable to such threats. This requires a combination of integrated approaches and actions to demonstrate health systems resilience attributes across sectors such as policymaking and service delivery. Such approaches include systems thinking and all hazards public health emergency management. This course offers an integrated approach to understanding health systems and services in relation to their resilience to public health threats. It explores key requirements for enabling health system resilience and addresses major challenges and fragmentation in current health systems strengthening and public health efforts.

We will work with the contention that sexuality, along with connected notions of masculinity and femininity, are largely social constructions, and have been the object of intense social scrutiny and political regulation. We will investigate sexual desire and behavior, and sexual and gender ideologies, and will explore how they relate to a variety of topics such as race, marriage, reproduction, same-sex relations, religion, and the politics of state building.",

        "Description": "Examination of women in European society from the mid-eighteenth century to the present. The course emphasizes women\u2019s life experiences within the context of larger historical changes in Europe (including the economy, cultural life, and social movements). Thus, a major goal of the course is to present women\u2019s history both as an integral part of European social and cultural history and as a unique subject of historical investigation. Students will learn to think critically about historical arguments and to understand both the difference that gender makes in history and the differences among women\u2019s historical experiences. The course will examine how diversity of class, race and nation shaped women\u2019s lives by focusing on white aristocratic, middle-class and working-class women, as well as colonized and women of color.",

The basic concepts of number theory lead to modular arithmetic; ideals in rings; and to examples of integral domains, division rings and fields as quotient rings. The concept of primes yields the algebraic concepts of unique factorization domains, Euclidean rings, and prime and maximal ideals of rings.

        "Description": "Propositional and first-order logic are developed. The basic framework of formal languages, logical structures and their models is given. Formal deductive systems for logical proofs are\u00a0set in an algorithmic framework. The completeness and compactness theorems for consistent axiom systems are proven, including the Lowenheim-Skolem theorems. The last half of the course focuses on the work of Goedel. Using Goedel\u2019s numbering of number theoretic formulae and proofs, his theorem asserting the incompleteness (inability to prove all true statements) of any consistent axiomatization of the natural numbers that is recursively given are proven. Related results of Tarski and Rosser, his second incompleteness theorem; the impossibility of Peano arithmetic, if consistent, to prove its own consistency are also proven. Time permitting, the course will introduce Goedel\u2019s proof of the consistency of Cantor\u2019s continuum hypothesis and axiom of choice with the usual axioms of\u00a0set theory.",

Why do some new leaders choose to close the past with a one-line condemnation, while others establish a year-long truth commission and still others initiate a decade of criminal prosecutions? This class focuses on the political, rather than judicial, side of transitional justice, taking into account the elite calculus of risk and advantage inherent in the variety of policies political leaders have at their disposal.",

Next, we consider democratization from the viewpoint of the citizen in non-democratic states. In this section, we look both at the role of the masses and that of counter-elite activists as they seek to weaken the non-democratic state and replace it with a democratic alternative. Since these actors are frequently assisted by outside states, and especially the United States, we subsequently consider the pros and cons of democracy assistance. Finally, this class looks at the various conundrums common to democratizing states, ranging from choosing appropriate institutional mechanisms to the process of dealing with past human rights abuses and abusers.",
